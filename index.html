    <h1>Soon enough. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</h1>
    
    Hey, whatcha watching? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? You don't know how to do any of those. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

You are the last hope of the universe.
Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
Throw her in the brig. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. No! Don't jump! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? How much did you make me?

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

What are their names? You lived before you met me?! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Why would I want to know that? Shut up and take my money!
